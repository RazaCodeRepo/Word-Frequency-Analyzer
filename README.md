# Word-Frequency-Analyzer
This software determines the words with the highest frequency in a group of input files. This information is useful for search
engines during predicting user input.

The entire source code of the project is contained in the file WordsInFile.java. The input to the program consists of 4
different text files. All these files are attached in the repo.
